20k starting resources
1 mothership + 2 resource collectors to start
resource collector holds 2.5k
asteroid size of max.4 min.2, scaleable 10k, 5 per cluster
10 sec to full 2.5k collector, 2.5k / 10000 = 0.25 resources/millisecond
asteroids mass has to correspond to weight of resources to continue
asteroid mass = 1000 * scale + (0.1 * resources)
discrepancy: On scratch, mass of asteroid is entirely resource
on asteroid.java, mass is (scale x 1000) + (0.1 x resources)

asteroid e.x.

asteroid of 20k resources
2k mass
2k / 20k = 0.1
0.1 = mass of one resource
0.4 mass every 16 millisec

2000 mass + 20000 * 0.1
2000 + 2000
4000

battleship = 50k - 200s
bomber = 7.5k - 30s
laser frigate = 25k - 100s
scout = 3k - 12s
space station = 120k - 480s
